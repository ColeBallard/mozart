## Description
App that transforms a spotify playlist into a new song using machine learning.

## Design
- have user input a playlist with 10-30 songs
- get playlist metadata from [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) using (Spotify Web API JS)[https://github.com/JMPerez/spotify-web-api-js] and downloading each track from the playlist using (spdl-core)[https://github.com/SkyDonald/spdl-core]
- generate song based on inputted music using [Tensorflow JS](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs) model

- model should train on a variety of (good?) songs
